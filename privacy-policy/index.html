                    <p>Thank you for visiting the Lea Studios website and reviewing our Privacy Policy. Our policy is very simple: we do not collect your user data unless you choose to provide that information voluntarily via email. This privacy policy describes how and when personal data might be collected by other entities while using our app.</p>
                  <br>
                    <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy ("Policy"). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide ("Personal Information") in the "Agatha Christie Reading List" mobile application ("Mobile Application" or "Service") and any of its related products and services (collectively, "Services"), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that Personal Information. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update it.</p>
                  <br>
                    <p>This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you ("User", "you" or "your") and this Mobile Application developer ("Operator", "we", "us" or "our"). If you are entering into this Policy on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Policy, in which case the terms "User", "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, you must not accept this Policy and may not access and use the Mobile Application and Services. By accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
                  <br>
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--secondary-color);">Links to other resources</h3>
                    <p>The Mobile Application and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Mobile Application and Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal Information.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--secondary-color);">Email</h3>
                    <p>We only use your email to respond to any emails you send to us. We do not delete the emails or your email address unless you ask us to. Your email will sit on the email server until such time as you ask for it to be removed or we close that email account.</p>

                    <p>We do not distribute your email nor do we compile emails into a list of any kind. You write to us, we write back. That's it.</p>

                    <p>Our website and emails are hosted on Digital Ocean.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--secondary-color);">Camera/Photo Gallery</h3>
                    <p>The Photo API used in the app will ask if you allow the app to access your photo gallery or camera in order to be able to change or add your book covers. If you decline then you won't be able to change book covers. You can change this access at any time through your phone's Settings app. We never see anything identifiable through this process. Behind the scenes, we get a yes or no.</p>

                    <p>Book cover photos that you add to the app get saved on your device and nowhere else. Please note: The app is not password protected so the photos could be viewable by anyone who can open the app by having access to your unlocked phone. We are not responsible for any photos added to the app.</p>

                    <p>Apple Photos Policy: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/photos" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/photos</a></p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--secondary-color);">Web Views</h3>
                    <p>The app allows users to view Wikipedia pages that talk about Agatha Christie and her books. We do not track which pages are viewed. All pages open up in Safari and there is the possibility of being able to surf the web after opening the Wikipedia page. Any data collected is done so by the browser and not anything we can (or care to) access.</p>

                    <p>Safari Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/safari/" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/safari/</a></p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--secondary-color);">Notes Text Fields</h3>
                    <p>Any notes you add to the app get saved on your device and are not viewable by us or any other app or service. Please note: The app is not password protected so the notes could be viewable by anyone who can open the app by having access to your unlocked phone. Be careful about putting any personal information in this area. We are not responsible for any information stored in the Notes feature.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--secondary-color);">Buy on Apple Books</h3>
                    <p>We do not collect any personal data or payment data when you purchase books through the app through Apple Books. This is all handled by Apple Books and we are only able to view aggregate unidentifiable data reports to track sales for affiliate commission.</p>

                    <p>Apple Books Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-books/#:~:text=We%20collect%20user%20interactions%20with,a%20particular%20user's%20reading%20activity." target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-books/#:~:text=We%20collect%20user%20interactions%20with,a%20particular%20user's%20reading%20activity.</a></p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--secondary-color);">Rating the App</h3>
                    <p>We do not collect or see any user data when you choose to leave a rating or review on the App Store except for what is publicly available in the review.</p>

                    <p>App Store Policy: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/app-store" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/app-store</a></p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--secondary-color);">Analytics</h3>
                    <p>We do not use any analytics within the app. Any analytics gathered by the App Store is aggregated and unidentifiable by us to view how many times the app has been downloaded and what country it was downloaded in.</p>

                    <p>Apple Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/</a></p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--secondary-color);">Location</h3>
                    <p>The app is able to ask what the location (country) of the user is only to determine if the user is in the United States or not. Nothing is logged or seen by us but there is a behind the scenes action that lets the app know whether or not to show the free ebooks. Only users in the United States can access the ebooks due to copywrite laws. Users in other countries will not see these ebooks. The app does not collect or save this information anywhere. The action is performed each time the app is opened.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--secondary-color);">Privacy of children</h3>
                    <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through the Mobile Application and Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child's Personal Information from our Services.</p>

                    <p>We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without their permission.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--secondary-color);">Information security</h3>
                    <p>No data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and the Mobile Application and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--secondary-color);">Changes and amendments</h3>
                    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Mobile Application and Services at any time at our discretion. An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Mobile Application and Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal Information was collected.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--secondary-color);">Acceptance of this policy</h3>
                    <p>You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services and submitting your information you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to access or use the Mobile Application and Services.
